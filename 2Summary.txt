 ML algorithms are deployed by educational institutions to predict students' learning behaviours and academic achievements, thereby giving them the opportunity to detect at risk students early and then develop strategies to help them overcome their weaknesses. Machine learning models learn from experiences or observations and then become very active to achieve human like actions  6, 7 . Forecasting of learning outcomes using the machine learning approach can help educational institutions to understand the learning patterns and behaviours of their students , which can be useful in improving school pol  icies , curriculum preparations , and teacher methodology  10  . Machine learning can be applied in di erent areas, including DNA sequence classi cation, image processing such as face de  tection, speech recognition aka natural language process  ing, security, search engine algorithms, and academic forecasting  34, 35 .  26   e study was empirical, and it showed the ability of KNN in prediction of learning patterns of students  e paper provided AI based solutions to track students' performance and was able to recommend diagnosis for the Moroccan students  e paper provided evidence on the signi cance of AI in management of education data and decision making  e paper concluded that ML will be required more in the future because of the need to assist students to overcome learning di culties and also enhance their productivity in learning Phauk and Takeo  27   e study recommended the use of the hybrid machine learning algorithm approach to solve misclassi cation issues and improve academic prediction accuracy  e research proposed an ensemble method to feature selection that combines the results of numerous independent feature lists generated by various features that may be used in education  e study provided a better approach for managing students' information system via ML  e study showed that the student's success with the aid of machine learning can be monitored using their previous performance data before they engaged in the current program  e study a rmed the applicability of ML in education technology development and deployment  ey developed a smart algorithm that assessed the teaching methods of teachers and how it a ects the understanding of their lessons by students in the class taking into consideration the former knowledge of students  ey examined the various implications of ML and other relevant AI driven systems in higher education Onan and Koruko glu  28  Onan  29  Feders and Anders  32  Popenici and Kerr  33  Hassen et al. Machine learning forecasting It gives more accurate predictions with minimal loss function  10, 13   e approach is more scienti cally driven  26  Very demanding in computation  39  It is more prone to under tting and over tting issues  40  Focuses more on result or outcome, but silent relationships among variables. Machine learning models can be trained with large volumes of data which it tends to un  derstand later and  gure out di erent trends and patterns in the data that ordinarily would prove very di cult for humans to comprehend. Machine learning al  gorithms gain, learn, and acquire experiences overtime, which help them become better and better in their pre  diction ability. Forecasting accuracy is vital as it helps educational institutions to make adequate planning and preparations towards future events which include risks, thereby giving them enough time to  nd measures to mitigate its e ects. Forecasting of Large Volume of Education Data. Machine learning can be relied on by education institutions to help them interpret data relating to emergencies especially as it concerns crisis that can lead to shutdown of schools. ML algorithms rely on data to learn and predict academic events. Machine learning generally relies on very strong assumptions about the statistical sta  bility of the environment. Machine learning algorithms require su cient time to train and learn to be able to function e ectively.
